# Digital DaVinci v1.0
#
 This is my 1st Rust project that incorporates WebAssembly, Webpack, HTML, and js.
 The Cargo.toml and package.json will show all the goods that will be used behind the scenes to pull this project off.
#
I will be perfectly honest, Rust is a tough language to get down and is still a work in progress. If you throw in WebAssembly and Webpack in, my brain or what is left of it is mush....i.e. it was incredibly painful at times debugging this.
#
If you opened the console on the browser your running DD on, you will see I left the console.log mechanism in place. This was an incredible tool that helped me a great deal in debugging.
#
Yes, I'm incredibly proud of this WebAssembly project and have learned so much. A SPECIAL shout out goes to Luis Ramirez Jr. and the gang out at ZTM Academy(Andrei included!). 
#
I hope it will help land me job!
#
I've included the before and after png files. What I did notice and never gave it a thought is that after DD changed the png to grayscale. It was actually smaller in size compared to the original.
#
As for my Git/Github sanity check, I did the initial setup and push the project from my desktop up to GitHub. Then I made a couple of tiny changes and pushed those up to the repo on GitHub to verify the plumbing.
